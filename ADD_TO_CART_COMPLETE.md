# ✅ Add to Cart - Complete Implementation & Fix

## 🔧 Critical Fix Applied

**Issue**: The Toaster component from `sonner` was missing from the app layout, causing toast notifications to not appear when users clicked "Add to Cart". This made it seem like the button wasn't working, even though items WERE being added to localStorage.

**Solution**: Added `<Toaster />` component to `src/app/layout.tsx`
